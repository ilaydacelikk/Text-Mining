# Text-Mining
Text Mining in Python

This text is taken from Afet İnan's book 'Atatürk Hakkında Hatıralar ve Belgeler' from the 'Kadın Hakları Üzerine' section. About this section we will practice text mining.
Since it will be difficult to examine the text in its raw form, we need to implement some processes to standardize it.Let's do these steps in order.

On the data set, respectively;

##### • To correct typos, we converted them to the Dataframe format and corrected the errors.
#####  • We wrote all the words in the same format.
##### • We removed the integer ones from the data.
##### • We have removed the stopword words and punctuation marks from the text.
##### • we have separated the words to their roots.
##### • We looked at how many characters are in each line. 
##### • We graphed the words that are the majority in the text.
##### • In the same way, we graphed a sentence that we chose spontaneously.
